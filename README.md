# FilmByte!

This was my team's project of week 5 during FAC, to which I added the missing error handling. In order to see it one needs to clone this repo and run it locally as the version on heroku doesn't include the error handling updates.


## WHY (describing the purpose)

Abdullah spends so much time trying to find a movie to watch that he ends up not watching one at all. He would like to be able to choose a year and/or a genre and get a random movie suggestion fitting those requirements.

He would like to see the movies poster, a summary, it's release data and running time and a review if possible. It would be nice if he could see a trailer for the movie aswell.

## WHAT (describing your site)

FilmByte returns a random film based on a chose genre and year a user selects.

### User Stories

As a user, I can:

1. Enter a date between 1896-2017
2. Select a genre from a dropdown menu
3. Get a random movie suggestion

### Stretch Goals
