## WHY (describing the purpose)

Abdullah spends so much time trying to find a movie to watch that he ends up not watching one at all. He would like to be able to choose a year and/or a genre and get a random movie suggestion fitting those requirements.

He would like to see the movies poster, a summary, it's release data and running time and a review if possible. It would be nice if he could see a trailer for the movie aswell.
